# Draft: Hooks & Plugin Architecture Research

## Requirements (confirmed)
- Understand hooks system architecture (hooks/, src/hooks/)
- Document hook types and their lifecycle
- Analyze server-pool mechanism
- Analyze plugin.json structure and role
- ALL findings must include file:line citations
- No implementation — research/documentation only
- Goal: inform future token optimization planning

## Technical Decisions
- Pure read-only exploration via explore agents
- Output: structured findings document with citations

## Open Questions
- Token optimization direction: reduce payload, refactor hooks, or general map?
